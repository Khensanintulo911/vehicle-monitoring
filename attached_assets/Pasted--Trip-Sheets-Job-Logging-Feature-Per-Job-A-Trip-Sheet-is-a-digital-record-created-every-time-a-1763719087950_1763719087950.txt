✅ Trip Sheets / Job Logging Feature (Per Job)

A Trip Sheet is a digital record created every time a driver goes to a job.

The flow is simple:
1️⃣ Manager assigns a job to a driver

Customer name

Job location

Expected time

Vehicle assigned

Any instructions

OR the technician selects from a list of assigned jobs.

2️⃣ Driver starts the trip

On their mobile device (Django mobile UI):

✔ Select "Start Trip"
✔ Select the job
✔ System automatically logs:

Start time

GPS starting point

Assigned vehicle

Driver ID

They can also enter:

Odometer (km)

Fuel level (percentage or litres)

3️⃣ Driver can log events during the job

Examples:

🚧 Delay
⛽ Fuel stop
💥 Incident / damage
📍 Reached customer location
📸 Upload job photos

They simply click “Add Event to Trip”.

4️⃣ Driver ends the trip

When the job finishes:

✔ Click “End Trip”
System automatically logs:

End time

GPS ending point

Distance travelled

Route taken

Duration

After-hours flag (if applicable)

Driver can enter:

Final odometer reading

Notes

🔥 What the System Automatically Calculates

When the driver submits a trip sheet:

✔ Start → End distance (GPS + odometer)

✔ Route taken vs. expected route
✔ Time taken vs. estimated time
✔ Fuel efficiency (km/L if fuel was logged)
✔ After-hours or weekend movement
✔ Personal detours
✔ Job completion status

This data then feeds directly into the Streamlit dashboard.

🧭 How This Connects With GPS Data

When a trip starts:

System begins recording GPS points

On trip end, GPS trail is linked to the trip sheet

Managers can view the entire map of the route

Unauthorized stops are flagged

📊 How Streamlit Uses This Data

The dashboard will show:

✔ Trip-by-trip details
✔ Time taken per job
✔ Fuel per job
✔ Distance per job
✔ Route comparison
✔ Technician performance
✔ Repeat issues (late start, detours, missing photo evidence)

And generate:

📄 Weekly trip summary
📄 Driver performance scorecard
📄 Vehicle usage history

🔧 Implementation Breakdown
Django Models

You will need models like:

Job

Trip

TripEvent

Vehicle

Driver

GPSRoutePoints

FuelLog

Django stores all trip data.

Streamlit

Reads data via API:

/api/trips/

/api/trips/<id>/

/api/trips/<id>/gps-route/

/api/trip-events/

Displays analytics.

🔥 This Solves Multiple Problems at Once
✔ Accountability

Drivers can’t claim they were working when GPS says otherwise.

✔ Fuel management

Fuel logs + distance = efficiency.

✔ Route compliance

GPS vs job location stops personal usage.

✔ Customer service

You know exactly when the driver arrived.

✔ Maintenance

Trip odometer logs help schedule services.
